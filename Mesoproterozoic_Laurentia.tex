%A few thoughts:
%
%1. Compiling dates of Grenvillian Orogeny and Shawinigan Orogeny:
%It's always good to have compilations, for sure, but whether this would 
%lead to clarity about timing of GO and SO seems less certain to me. Age 
%determinations in high-grade metamorphic rocks are commonly complicated 
%by the presence of igneous cores and metamorphic rims, and many of the 
%existing age data for the GP in Canada were done 20-40 years ago by the 
%traditional TIMS method of Tom Krogh --> whole-grain Zrn dissolution 
%(both single grain and multi-grain samples) after physical abrasion of 
%grain rims - mostly without prior CL or BSE imaging. Krogh and followers 
%generally separated populations into prismatic and rounded soccer ball 
%grains, interpreted as igneous and metamorphic respectively, but the 
%lack of imaging raises a flag for me. Moreover, although the results are 
%commonly precise, their geological significance is not always easy to 
%interpret. For instance, Ottawan ages of 1090, 1060 and 1020 Ma have 
%been determined in different samples/ parts of the orogen, but their 
%significance can only be inferred from other commonly independent data. 
%Moreover, the geological significance of a date for a regional 
%metamorphic event with an uncertainty of +/- 2 Ma is questionable. It 
%must be a specific reaction that is being dated, not the long-lived 
%metamorphic event involving the cycle of crustal burial, heating, 
%exhumation and cooling.
%
%In summary, I think there is a need to revisit many of these samples / 
%results and run them with a method that links the geochronometer to the 
%reaction history of the sample; SHRIMP dating of Zrn rims and cores, or 
%Mnz dating coupled with REE zoning, as practised at Mike's lab, look 
%like the currently best ways to go. Then we will be in a better position 
%to compare ages along the length of the orogen.
%
%2. WRT the time of initial collision between Laurentia and Amazonia, all 
%ages in the GP are metamorphic ages, so this info is not directly 
%available from Laurentia as far as we know. However, there is a hiatus 
%in metamorphic ages between what has been inferred to be the end of the 
%Shawinigan Orogeny at ca. 1140 and the onset of the GO at ca. 1090 Ma 
%which presumably brackets the time of collision.
%
%3. I agree that it's time to re-assess the link / relationship between 
%the MCR and the GO. As mentioned in one of the presentations, there is 
%evidence that magmatism in the MCR started as early as ~1060 Ma 
%(kimberlite magmatism; paper by Heaman et al - in 2000s I think), which 
%coincides with AMCG magmatism, emplacement of Abitibi dyke etc., and the 
%Shawinigan orogeny. As far as I know, this temporal link has not been 
%explored in detail. As discussed in the meeting, the volumetric peak of 
%magmatism appears to have coincided with the early Ottawan phase of the 
%GO; this temporal link is also worth additional scrutiny... Of course, 
%temporal links as just that, and do not prove common causality.
%That said, I have always found the analysis of Bill Cannon regarding the 
%closure of the MCR during the Ottawan phase to be quite compelling.
%
%4. An elephant in the room is the tectonic setting of emplacement of the 
%AMCG suite along the SE Laurentian margin during the latter stages of 
%the Shawinigan orogeny (ca. 1170-1140 Ma). This enormously volumetric 
%suite must have been a result of an important magmatic process in the 
%mantle. All proposed explanations so far seem to have come up short, and 
%the problem has only become more intractable since the discovery that 
%the megacrysts in some AMCG suites have ages several hundred M.y. older 
%than their host magmas (paper by Bybee et al a few years ago).
%In addition, given that the evidence for the Shawinigan Orogeny is 
%widespread in the western GP and the inliers in the Appalachians, but 
%much less evident in the eastern GP, the temporal overlap between the SO 
%and AMCG suite magmatism may be coincidental rather than process-driven.
%
%5. Turning points: Not quite sure how to define a turning point, but 
%here are a few suggestions to consider: Turning point (i) closure of a 
%large Pacific-type ocean following the prolonged latest Paleoproterozoic 
%and Mesoproterozoic subduction-accretion beneath/to SE Laurentia, 
%leading to formation of the accretionary GPAO; (ii) Formation of double 
%crust and an orogenic plateau in the Ottawan phase of the Grenvillian 
%Orogeny; (iii) Collapse of the Ottawan double crust in the GO; (iv) 
%Initiation of subduction of the Laurentian plate (double bivergent 
%subduction) during the Rigolet phase; (v) Rodinia assembly - comparison 
%of Laurentian record with those from other continental fragments in 
%Rodinia; (vi) break-up of Rodinia, and opening of new ocean basins.
%
%I realize reading this through that it is too Grenvillian-centred. Need 
%to also include Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic sedimentation in 
%basins on and surrounding Laurentia.
%
%Enough for now; hope you find these thoughts useful...
